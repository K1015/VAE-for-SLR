# Be a Goldfish: Forgetting Bad Conditioning in Sparse Linear Regression via Variational Autoencoders
Code to replicate the results of the manuscript submission to ICML 2025 (Submission Number: 15780).

# Libraries reuqired: 
- numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn

# Please run the following python files to generate the plots for Fig. 1 in the manuscript.
* Figure 1(a) using Gaussian Identitiy Matrix - Test_Gaussian_Identity.py
* Figure 1(b) using Gaussian Random Walk Matrix - Test_Gaussian_RandomWalk.py
* Figure 1(c) using Riboflavin Dataset Matrix - Test_Biomedical_Matrix.py

The codes for the SLR will be updated with more experimental details upon acceptance.
